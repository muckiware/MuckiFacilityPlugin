## Respoitory Configuration
First you will need a repository configuration for the backup. The repository configuration is the base for the backup process. The repository configuration contains the backup source and the backup target. The backup source is the path to the folder or file which should be backuped. The backup target is the path to the repository where the backup data should be restored.<br>
<br>Settings -> Extensions -> Backup Repositories -> Add Repository<br>for to create a new repository configuration.

| Technical Name     | Free choose as a technical name, is just for better to organize the backup configurations                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Database dump type | Choose the typ of database dump backup. As separate dump files for each table, only one dump file for the complete database, or none database dump.                                                                                                                                      |
| Repository Path      | Absolute path to the backup repository folder. **Note that this path cannot be changed after creation!**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Repository Password       | The backup repository will be encryped by a password. Remembering this password is very important! If you lose it, you wonâ€™t be able to get access to the data stored in the repository outside of the shop functionality. **Note that this password cannot be changed after creation!** |
| Restore Path      | Enter here the absolute path for the target of the restored data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Backup Paths
Use the __Add backup path__-button for to define the files and folders which should be backup. You can choose a complete folder, or a single file.<br>
![backup_paths_config.png](img%2Fbackup_paths_config.png)<br>
You can define for each path item a compress option. If the compress option is active, the backup data will be compressed by gzip. For folders which containing mainly compressed image files, additional compression during backup would make less sense.

### Delete of snapshots
You can remove old snapshots of a repository with the command.
```shell
bin/console muckiware:backup:snapshots --delete <backupRepositoryId>
```
This setup defines the daily, weekly, month or yearly values for this remove process. More details about the keep-parameters you can find in the restic documentation https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/060_forget.html#removing-snapshots-according-to-a-policy

### Initial Backup
Finally, click on the __Create new Repository__-button, for to create a new backup repository. This action creates then a configuration item in the shop database. And it creates the backup repository folder which is defined in the __Repository Path__ field.

like this:<br>
![backup-rep-folder.png](img%2Fbackup-rep-folder.png)

## Create Backup
### cli
You can create a backup by the command line interface with the following command:
```shell
bin/console muckiware:backup:create <backupRepositoryId>
```
### Administration panel
You can also create a backup in the administration panel. 
- Go into the list of backup configurations under Settings -> Extensions -> Backup Repositories
- Select the backup repository
- Click on the __Start backup__-button<br>
  ![start_backup_progess.png](img%2Fstart_backup_progess.png)<br>

This action does not start the backup process immediately, it will be started as a background process. After a short while, you can see under the __checks__-tab the status of the backup checks, as well as the snapshots of each database and path item in the __Snapshots__-tab<br>


## Command Line Interface
| Command                                                                      | Desc                                                          |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```bin/console muckiware:backup:check <backupRepositoryId>```                | Checks a backup repository                                    |
| ```bin/console muckiware:backup:create <backupRepositoryId>```               | Creates a new backup by backup repository configuration       |
| ```bin/console muckiware:backup:forget <backupRepositoryId>```               | Removes snapshots of a backup repository by forget parameters |
| ```bin/console muckiware:backup:snapshots <backupRepositoryId>```            | Gets a list of snapshots in a backup repository id            |
| ```bin/console muckiware:backup:restore <backupRepositoryId> <snapshotId>``` | Restore data by backup repository id and snapshot id          |
| ```bin/console muckiware:db:dump <Type of backup>```                         | Creates just a database dump by global plugin setups          |
### Cronjob
You can create a cronjob for to create a backup automatically. This should be the usual configuration for creating backups. The cronjob should be executed by the user which is running the shopware instance. The following command is an example for the cronjob configuration:
```shell
* 3 * * * php /var/www/html/bin/console muckiware:backup:create <backupRepositoryId>
30 5 * * * php /var/www/html/bin/console muckiware:backup:forget <backupRepositoryId>
```
The first row creates a backup every day at 3:00 am. The second row removes old snapshots every day at 5:30 am.

## Database dumps
Backups via command line interface are possible with the following commands:
```shell
bin/console muckiware:db:dump <backupType>
```
| Option backup type                   | Desc                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| completeDatabaseSingleFile (default) | Backup the complete database as single file. The backup is stored in the directory `var/backup/db/` with the filename `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_db_backup.sql.gz`                                |
| completeDatabaseSeparateFiles        | Backup the complete database as single file for each database table. The backup is stored in the directory `var/backup/YYYY-MM-DD` with the filename `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_tablename.sql.gz` |

This command execute a backup of the database. The backup is stored in the directory `var/backup/db/` with the filename `db_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.sql.gz`
## Restore
As long as the shopware instance is running, you can restore the backup data via cli like this:
```shell
bin/console muckiware:backup:restore 019403b49bed7109a1e238139fb759c5 8888ec40
```
Or you can choose the snapshot id from the list of snapshots in the administration panel.
- Settings -> Extensions -> Backup Repositories
- Select the backup repository
- Click on the Snapshots-tab
- And select in die list of snapshots the snapshot id for to restore the data.
  ![select_snapshot_for_restore.png](img%2Fselect_snapshot_for_restore.png)
This action will start the restore process of the backup data as a background process.

But if the shop instance is not running anymore, you can use the native restic commands for to restore the backup data.
```shell
restic -r /srv/restic-repo restore 79766175 --target /tmp/restore-workdir 
```
Checkout the description of the restic command for more information. https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/050_restore.html#
